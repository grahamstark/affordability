Modelling Affordability Using the Family Resources Survey
=============================================================

This is a piece of work for the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator
(OSCR) on modelling the ability the ability of beneficiaries to afford fees
charged by charities.

The model is, however, very general, and could easily be adapted to model the
affordabily of (e.g) fuel, housing, etc.

The code will need some updating to run with the latest FRS datasets and the
latest [Tax Benefit Model
Components](https://github.com/grahamstark/tax_benefit_model_components)
codebase.
